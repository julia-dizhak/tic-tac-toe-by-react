# Tic tac toe game 
build by React

## Setting up the project

```yarn add create-react-app```

```
yarn create-react-app app-name
rm -f src/*
```

```yarn start``` - starts the development server.

```yarn build``` - bundles the app into static files for production.

I suggest that you begin by typing:
```
cd app
yarn start
```

## Getting started
In particular, we have three components:
```
Square
Board
Game
```
The Square component renders a single ```<button>```, the Board renders 9 squares, and the Game component renders a board with some placeholders that weâ€™ll fill in later. None of the components are interactive at this point
