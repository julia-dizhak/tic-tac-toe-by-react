# Tic tac toe game 
build by React

## Setting up the project

```yarn add create-react-app```

```
yarn create-react-app app-name
rm -f src/*
```



```yarn start``` - starts the development server.

```yarn build``` - bundles the app into static files for production.

I suggest that you begin by typing:
```
cd app
yarn start
```
